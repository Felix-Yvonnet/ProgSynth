## DeepCoder

This is a dataset of:
> *M. Balog, A. L. Gaunt, M. Brockschmidt, S. Nowozin, and D. Tarlow.* Deep-coder: Learning to write programs. In International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR, 2017. URL <https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx>.

This folder contains two files.
The `deepcoder.py` file contains an impelementation of the DSL along with a default evaluator.
The `convert_deepcoder.py` is a runnable python script which enables you to convert the original deepcoder dataset files to the ProgSynth format.

### Downloading Deepcoder

You can download the archive from here: <https://storage.googleapis.com/deepcoder/dataset.tar.gz>. Then you simply need to:

```bash
gunzip dataset.tar.gz
tar -xf dataset.tar
```

You should see a few JSON files, these JSON files are now convertible with the `convert_deepcoder.py` script.
